    <h3>Seared ahi tuna steaks with a sweet and spicy soy marinade</h3>
    These ahi tuna steaks are a delicious addition to a poke bowl with steamed rice and fresh produce.
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ahi tuna steaks</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp canola oil</li>
        <li>green onions, toasted sesame seeds, and lime wedges (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat the ahi tuna steaks dry with a paper towel. Place on a plate or inside a plastic bag.</li>
        <li>Mix the soy sauce (2 tablespoons), toasted sesame oil (1 tablespoon), honey (1 tablespoon) kosher salt (1/2 teaspoon- OMIT if marinating for more than a couple hours, see notes), pepper (1/4 teaspoon), and cayenne pepper (1/4 teaspoon) until honey is fully dissolved. Pour over the ahi tuna steaks and turn over to coat completely. Optional: allow to marinate for at least 10 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator. Also optional: Reserve a spoonful or two of the marinade before coating the fish for drizzling on top after you've cooked it.</li>
        <li>Heat a medium skillet (preferably non-stick or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet) on medium-high to high until very hot ( or medium medium-high for nonstick). I recommend giving cast iron 3-5 minutes to get hot and nonstick about 1 minute, depending on how thick it is.</li>
        <li>Add the canola oil (1 tablespoon) to the hot pan. Sear the tuna for 1 – 1½ minutes on each side for medium rare ( 2 -2½ minutes for medium-well to well, 30 seconds for very rare. See notes – this will vary based on thickness of the tuna steaks). (Note: different burners get hotter depending on your stove. Use your best judgement whether you use medium, medium-high, or high heat, as the marinade may burn if too high heat is used)</li>
        <li>Remove to a cutting board. Slice into 1/2 inch slices and serve garnished with green onions, toasted sesame seeds, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice, if desired.</li>
    </ol>

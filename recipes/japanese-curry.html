    <h3>Japanese-style curry with chicken and vegetables</h3>
    This Japanese chicken curry is the ultimate comfort food for cold weather, striking a nutritious balance of flavors.
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>3 Yukon gold potatoes</li>
        <li>1 tsp ginger</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 apple</li>
        <li>1 1/2 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tbsp neutral oil</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock/broth</li>
        <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ketchup</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut 2 onions into wedges. I like to have the texture of the onions in my curry, so I cut them into thick wedges. If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions so they disintegrate into the sauce.</li>
        <li>Peel 2 carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it‘s called rangiri in Japanese). This type of cut creates more surface area, which helps the carrots absorb more flavor and cook faster.</li>
        <li>Peel 3 Yukon gold potatoes and cut them into quarters. Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
        <li>Grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and measure 1 tsp ginger with the juice. Set aside. Mince 2 cloves garlic and set aside (I use a garlic press later when adding to the pot).</li>
        <li>Cut ½ apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin.</li>
    </ol>
